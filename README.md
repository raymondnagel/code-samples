# code-samples

This repository contains a small assortment of source code files from my previous employment which do NOT constitute MCVE; in other words, they are part of much larger projects and will NOT run independently. Contents include a Java main class; a VB.NET main class; a SQL script used for creation of an embedded Derby database; and an SQL example statement library, stored as XML, for use with that database.
